# Testing Sent Notifications

Push is an open network and supports all platforms. This means that notifications work just like how Ethereum functions. The communications are stored in an open, distributed (and soon to be decentralised) network (much like how the backend of Ethereum stores the data).&#x20;

This can then fetched by any crypto frontend / wallet / software to display it out to their users (very similar to how frontend wallets like Metamask, Trust, Phantom, etc works).

This means you can see notifications on any platform or frontend that integrates Push. You can test out how notifications come by using any of the crypto frontends listed below or any other third party ones that have integrated the Push protocol.

#### iOS

:::caution
iOS doesn't have a public staging app (only production app is available on the App Store). \

Best way to test staging on iOS would be to join :point\_right: [Push Discord Channel](https://discord.com/invite/YVPB99F9W5) :point\_left: and ask a team member to provide you with a testflight beta link.&#x20;

# Polygon (Channel Setup)

## Setting Up Channel Alias for Polygon

:::info
**Important Note:** This part of the guide assumes that you have successfully created a channel and passed the correct Polygon address as the alias address during the channel creation process.

If you haven't set up your channel yet, please read the [..](../ "mention") section and create your channel with the right alias address.
:::

Now that you have the channel created successfully on the Ethereum chain, and you have passed your preferred alias address for the Polygon chain, let's quickly understand how you can verify your alias address.&#x20;

### Channel Verification on Alias Network

In order to ensure that the alias address provided (_during channel creation_) actually belongs to the owner of the channel, alias verification is included as a part of the channel creation procedure.

Additionally, a channel owner can only use his alias address to communicate with its subscribers on Polygon after the alias verification is successfully executed on the Polygon chain itself.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Alias Verification

Verification of alias address must happen on the selected chain (_in this case, Polygon_) itself. Therefore, once your channel is successfully created on Ethereum, you need to switch your network to Polygon.

:::info
_Make sure you have already added the Polygon network to your MetaMask._&#x20;

_In case you havenâ€™t, check out_ [_this guide_](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/#polygon-scan)_, on how to do it._
:::

Once you have switched your network to Polygon chain, follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Log into the Dapp with the same address that was set as **Alias Address** during channel creation.
2. Go to the **Create Channel** menu in the sidebar.
3. Click the **Verify Channel Alias** button.
4. Approve the transaction required for Alias Verification, on Polygon chain

That's it.&#x20;

Once the transaction is approved, your alias address is verified on Polygon and is now successfully set up and linked with your channel on the Ethereum chain.&#x20;

You shall now be able to access your channel profile page and be able to send notifications from Polygon using your alias address.

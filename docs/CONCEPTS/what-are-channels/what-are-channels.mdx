# What are Channels?

###  Quick explainer of what channels are, their state cycles and verifications

Any user who activates themselves as a service on the protocol to send notifications for its users can be considered a **Channel**.

In other words, any service, i.e., a dapp, protocol, or even a web2 service, that wants to send notifications out to its web3 users can choose to become a channel and establish an adequate communication bridge with its users.

The creation of a channel is just a one-time simple procedure. It must be noted that channel creation only happens on the **Ethereum** blockchain and one wallet address can only create one channel only the protocol.

**Note:** _Although channel creation only happens on the Ethereum blockchain, the protocol is designed to be chain-agnostic, i.e., channel owners can choose to send notification on any chain of their choice and not just Ethereum network_

_This is discussed extensively in the following section ðŸ‘‰_ [enabling-channel-on-other-chains](../../developer-guides/create-your-notif-channel/enabling-channel-on-other-chains/ "mention")__

:::

A successfully created channel is capable of _**sending notifications**_ to its subscribers, directly tied to their wallet addresses. Any wallet address can become a subscriber of a particular channel by simply **opting into** that channel.&#x20;

Once opted in, the subscriber shall receive notifications from that channel directly in their inbox. Users who are not a subscriber of a particular channel, receive notifications from that channel in their spam box.

_**Opting In or Opting out of a Channel is a completely gasless transaction and requires no fees.**_

:::

Moreover, the owner of a channel can also choose to _**delegate his/her notification sending power to any other wallet address**_. This enables the selected wallet address to send notifications on behalf of the channel. The channel owner, however, can choose to remove the delegate at any given time.&#x20;

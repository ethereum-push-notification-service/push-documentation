# Types of Notifications

### Quick explainer of the different types of Notifications

Below listed are the different types of notifications you can send to the subscribers of your channel on Push protocol. 👇🏼

* **Broadcast Notifications:** This type of notification is basically broadcasted or sent to all the subscribers of a channel at once.
* **Targeted Notifications:** As the name suggests, this type of notification allows channel owners to notify a specific wallet address.
* **Subset Notifications:** Subset notifications are quite helpful when a particular group of subscribers of a channel is supposed to be notified.

This list will keep on expanding as Push Protocol adds more and more notification types. For instance:

**Secret Notifications** => Notifications that are encrypted before sending using asymmetric encryption, i.e., the public key to encrypt and the private key to decrypt.

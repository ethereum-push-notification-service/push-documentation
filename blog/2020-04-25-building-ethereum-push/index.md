We are excited to announce that Ethereum Push Notification Service(EPNS) protocol has officially kicked off, yay !!

EPNS protocol is a way to send notifications out to users of different dApps (or potentially all users of Ethereum itself) via Web, Mobile (push notifications) or Web3 Providers. EPNS App Owners called Channels Owners can send mass unencrypted notifications (all users in their specific app group), or encrypted targetted messages to specific users in their App Group called Channels.

EPNS was conceptualized and ideated for EthGlobal [Hack Money](https://ethglobal.online/) 2020. During the 30 day virtual hackathon, we will try to build, design, and deliver a working EPNS app. We plan to push out regular development updates, milestones, and challenges along this journey. The idea is to learn and share the learnings with the community.

At the onset of the project, we are currently working on the architecture and tech specs that we will share in the upcoming posts.

#### Meet the Team

We are a mixed bag of techno-functional guys & gals hacking for the first time.

### About Push Protocol

Push is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.

We started with Jacob going over everything that entails coordinating these hackathons, and how the organization runs their ceremonies after each event finishes to ensure the next one its even better ‚Äî <i>‚Äúplan a lot, iterate a ton, and if you do this for a long time you‚Äôll end up with an amazing team passionate for building excellent events‚Äù.</i>

Funny stories that happen in hackathons to the teams and to the organization were also shared. Including the unknown story of a team called The Crypto Maniacs that built a now super popular DEX aggregator and chose the name of the project solely to be listed first in alphabetically in the projects list üòÖ. (check our [twitter spaces recording](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1dRKZlNEAmXJB) if you want to know which project we are talking about!)

After sharing all these cool stories and whats to come for ETH Global, Harsh took the opportunity to briefly go over the journey for EPNS as a project born in ETH Global‚Äôs Hack Money 2020 and all the great things that comes when you participate in a Hackathon. It‚Äôs the people you meet, the advise you get, and all the support that comes after to get your ideas to the next level üôèüèº

Before starting our conversation with the ETHNewYork BUIDLers, we took a few minutes to share the experience of the EPNS team in ETH Barcelona, and all the networking we were able to do there.

Now it was time to <b>Meet the BUIDLers!</b>

We had the opportunity to host 6 of the 22 teams that built with EPNS during the ETHNewYork Hackathon:

- <b>Common Grants:</b> we had Boyang explaining how they are making it easy for builders to apply and gain reputation in the form of evolving, nontransferable badges.

- <b>Linum Labs (Lens Integration with EPNS):</b> Mustafa (CTO of Linum Labs) took a moment to discuss the synergies between Lens and EPNS, and how it makes sense to put them together for a great product for Lens users.

- <b>Keyko:</b> Joseph described for us how they used EPNS‚Äôs targeted notifications to establish a communication channel between guardians and requesters for a better user experience for recovery processes.

- <b>Granted:</b> Granted implemented a milestone-based granting solution for grantors & grantees. Kate was with us to share how Granted aims to help builders getting into action faster and providing accountability to both sides.

- <b>Splytto:</b> Srilakshmi took the time to describe in detail their real-life use case that applies to every IRL event with friends ‚Äî Expense splitting ‚Äî and how they created a dApp for teams to split shares and settle it amongst themselves.

- <b>He(Art):</b> We had Maia & Sunny explaining us how their gamified DAO governed collective can enable artists and users to take part in the creation and funding of public social good projects.

Working together with these amazing teams and people during ETHNewYork was a wonderful experience. We look forward to continuing seeing your projects grow and our collaboration getting stronger in time.

Till next Friday Push!

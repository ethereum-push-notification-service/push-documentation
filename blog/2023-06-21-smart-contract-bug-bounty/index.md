## Impacts in Scope
Youâ€™re now ready to start some bug-hunting! But before you start, take a look at the impacts considered in the scope for the Bounty Program and the severity level of each impact:

### Critical Security Level:
- Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield
- Permanent freezing of funds
- Drain of Funds from contract
- Loss of funds due to bridging of tokens
### High Security Level:
- Theft of unclaimed yield
- Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Temporary freezing of funds
- User/Stakers being able to harvest more tokens than they should be able to.
- User/Stakers being able to harvest without staking for at least 1 complete epoch.
### Medium Security Level:
- Smart contract unable to operate due to lack of token funds
- Griefing (e.g. no profit motive for an attacker, but damage to the users or the protocol)
- Unbounded gas consumption
- Unfair reward distribution between users with equal staking details like token weight, stake duration etc.
### Low Security Level:
- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesnâ€™t lose value

All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something within the assets listed in the scope table. You can find all other details about the severity levels, bug impacts, program guidelines, and [rules in the report provided by Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/pushprotocol/).

Hackers and devs, itâ€™s your time to shine! Join us in securing the Push ecosystem and earn big for your valuable contributions. We look forward to seeing what you uncover.


### About Push Protocol

Push is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.

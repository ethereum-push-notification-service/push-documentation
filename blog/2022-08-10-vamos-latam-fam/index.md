Mariano was first to speak, and shared with everyone a little bit of what has been his life over the past year with all the travels he’s done and all the people he have met 🗺️. We discussed why Argentina became a hub for innovation due to all challenges people face on a daily basis. And we got the Alpha as to what he will be talking about during his talk in ETH Latam (<b><i>don’t miss it!</i></b>), and his “toy project” that as per Harsh “will change the world in the future!”.

We couldn’t miss the opportunity to get Mariano’s opinion on one of the most anticipated events in crypto — the <b>Ethereum Merge.</b> Looking forward for this moment to come!

Next in line — <b>Juan David</b> from the Colombia community 🇨🇴 brought the latino style into the conversation and decided to spanglish things up! He shared with the things he’s been up to for the past year and his participation in organizing DevCon Bogota.

With the ETH Latam communities reunited in this space, the conversation took an interesting shift into discussing the challenges & opportunities for the Latam region and the role Ethereum and the blockchain technologies play.

And in the blink of an eye we came to our last guest of the Latam Fam CryptoChica 🇦🇷. Given her vast contributions in creating educational content for the Spanish speaking community, we wanted to know “Who is <b>CryptoChica</b> and what has been her journey in the web3 space? — “Saludos a DeFi Latam”

We talked about the Quadratic Funding initiative that just started for projects aligned with Public Goods in Argentina, and soon to start in other countries.

To finalize, all our guests took a minute to talk about what everyone can expect when you come to Argentina and the ETH Latam event 🎉.

It was definitely a very fun time with friends and the Latam Fam in the house, we can’t wait to see you all in the Argentina.

Till next Friday Push!

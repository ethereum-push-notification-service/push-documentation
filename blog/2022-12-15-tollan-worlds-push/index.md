[Tollan Worlds](https://medium.com/u/5afd7b03aba2?source=post_page-----ba3f9697523--------------------------------), a web3 gaming platform, has joined forces with Push to power communication on their platform.

Blockchain gaming is leading the growth of the gaming industry. To enable more transparency in the gaming ecosystem, Tollan Worlds is bringing decentralized communication to its platform.

By integrating Push, Tollan Worlds is able to regularly announce development updates, new partnerships, community events, and giveaways to the gamer community directly.

In the fourth segment of ‚ÄòFrens of Push,‚Äô we are in conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/im_mkx"><b>Michael Kuvshynov</b></a>, co-founder and CEO of Tollan Worlds, to talk about how Push is enabling communication on the gaming platform. For all the gamers ‚Äî if you‚Äôd like to play Tollan Worlds and here‚Äôs the good news, the Tollan Worlds team is giving away <b>exclusive 30 access codes</b>. How to get the code? Keep reading!

## Hi Michael, what‚Äôs your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?
<b>Michael:</b> My blockchain journey started a few years ago. Coming from computer science and game design backgrounds as well as creating various content as a hobby, I saw the tremendous potential Web3 can bring to each of these directions. Kernel from Gitcoin has been my gateway into the decentralized world and taught me a lot about the values of the new web, most importantly about the sense of community and the power of decentralization on an ethical level. I believe whoever wants to start building in Web3 should stop asking what Web3 could do for them and instead ask what they could do for Web3.<br/><br/>

<blockquote>Gaming was always my passion, and I‚Äôve seen it as one of the biggest use cases for blockchain and especially NFT technologies. And here we are, building a pixel art MMO we call Tollan Worlds.</blockquote>

## Tell us about Tollan Worlds ‚Äî what‚Äôs it about, and what problem does Tollan Words solve?
<b>Michael:</b> Tollan Worlds is an online role-playing game where you play as an escapee from an authoritarian city with an imperial mentality called <i>The Mainland</i>. Finding your way through endless Darklands and finally stumbling upon a hidden developing society in the middle of nowhere. That‚Äôs where your journey finally begins.

Players will shape their own path through the main story as well as go to dungeons with their friends and join forces with many other players for massive boss fights. They can explore the vast world where each new place brings new creatures, stories, and unforgettable experiences while being determined to the main objective of defending their new home from the ubiquitous forces of The Mainland.

Our main goal is not only to create great gameplay with a deep story but also to create a fair and transparent monetization model while also putting players in charge of their game world, and blockchain allows us to achieve that.

Tollan Worlds ‚Äúsolves the problem‚Äù of both traditional and blockchain gaming worlds. Transparent monetization allows us to be closer to our player base and develop trust and long-term retention of our community. Focusing on the gameplay and story, and escaping Ponzi play2earn schemes allows us to create a game that doesn‚Äôt depend on market conditions and where money does not interfere with the core gameplay.

## How is Tollan using Push‚Äôs web3 communication layer?

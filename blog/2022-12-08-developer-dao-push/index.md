If you‚Äôre a Web3 enthusiast who envisions an internet that is free and collectively owned, <a href="https://www.developerdao.com/"><b>Developer DAO</b></a> is the community for you. With over 5000 members from around the world, D_D continues to accelerate its mission of empowering a new wave of Web3 builders through constant innovations and educational efforts.

We are excited to have Developer DAO as a part of the Push ecosystem and look forward to enhancing the community experience via decentralized communication. This is only the start of an amazing journey with D_D!

## Developer DAO X Push: What to expect
Facilitating a culture of ‚Äúlearning and growing together‚Äù is a cornerstone mission of D_D. With this in mind, the importance of streamlined community participation and governance is critical to the community‚Äôs success. This is where Push comes in.

Push Protocol addresses this user experience problem by providing a communication layer for wallets and dapps. Push allows any dapp, smart contract, backend, protocol, or, in principle, any distributed technology to send communication directly to user wallet addresses in an open and decentralized way. Being an open and permissionless protocol, anyone can create dedicated channels to distribute information directly to user wallets without needing to rely on centralized service providers.

### Push x D_D channel soon!
By creating a communication channel for D_D members, Push aims to encourage maximum participation by DAO members. Push will notify:

- When there is a new proposal on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth)
- 24 hrs before the proposal voting ends
- When there is a new Proposal topic created on the [D_D forum](https://forum.developerdao.com/c/proposals/5)
- When a Substack newsletter or blog post is live

D_D official channel will be live on [Push](https://app.push.org/) on Dec 13th. Members can simply opt-in and stay up-to-date with all the latest updates from Developer DAO.

Keep an eye out for all the surprises and exclusive events we have for the D_D community.

### About Push Protocol

Push is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.

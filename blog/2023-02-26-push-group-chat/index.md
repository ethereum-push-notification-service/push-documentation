We‚Äôre thrilled to announce the public launch of Push Chat and Push Group Chat. These latest additions to our suite of web3-native communication products are set to revolutionize the world of web3 messaging offering secure and speedy wallet-to-wallet communication for all.

Push Chat and Push Group Chat is now available to everyone!üí™

The public launch of Push Chat is a major step forward in realizing our vision of becoming the de-facto communication layer of web3. Our mission has always been to empower the user experience on web3, and we‚Äôre excited to see Push Chat and Push Group Chat take us one step closer to achieving this goal.

## How Does Push Chat Work?
With Push Chat now available to the public, web3 users can enjoy a seamless, secure, and truly private messaging experience. Using advanced technologies such as IPFS, encryption, and message pinning on Push Nodes, Push Chat ensures a no-message drop experience for the users. Additionally, each message and notification carries a unique [verification proof](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/PIPs/tree/main/definitions/Standard/PRC/Notification) that allows the front-end to confirm the authenticity of the sender and message content.

Push Protocol first announced Push Chat at Devcon in October 2022. The alpha was released to select members of the Push community. We‚Äôre excited now to make Push Chat available to anyone in the Push ecosystem.

You can learn more details about Push Nodes, sending and receiving messages on Push Chat, storage, and security of messages [here](https://medium.com/push-protocol/were-still-pushing-a-deeper-look-into-push-chat-90fdea8d9e8e).

## Push Chat: Paving the Way for Decentralized Communication
As the web becomes more decentralized, it‚Äôs crucial for applications to protect user data and prevent censorship. The Push Protocol team is taking on this fundamental problem in web3 with a two-step strategy that ensures [immutability of content](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/PIPs/tree/main/definitions/Standard/PRC/Notification) and elimination of censorship.

## What makes Push Chat an ideal messaging solution for web3 dapps and their users?
First, it is a permissionless protocol, meaning that any address on any platform can use their account to chat with any other account across web3, without the need to sign up with personal information. Second, Push Chat is forward-compatible, allowing it to adapt to any changes made to existing or new platforms. This ensures Push Chat remains a reliable and adaptable solution. Third, the user-friendly interface of Push Chat provides a familiar user experience that users can quickly learn. Finally, our Push Chat SDK allows developers to easily integrate the messaging layer into their application or service, improving their CI/CD processes.

If you‚Äôre looking to provide robust communication for your dapp and users, Push Chat is the solution you need!

## Introducing Push Group Chat ‚Äî A New Way to Collaborate on Push Chatü§ù
Say hello to the newest addition to Push‚Äôs communication solutions: Push Group Chat. Group Chat, inherent in its name, allows web3 users to create group chats, online communities, come together and share experiences natively on web3.

With the introduction of Group Chat, the potential use cases for Push Chat expand to include applications for DAOs, NFT communities, gaming, and more.

Additionally, since Push Chat is built on top of Push Nodes, if you choose to, every chat message sent or received can have notifications natively! All web2 communications start with a notification, so why should web3 be any different?

## What are the Group Chat features?
Group Chat comes with several functionalities to enhance the chat experience on your dapp including:

- Token gate your group: Choose to allow only addresses that hold an ERC20 or a certain NFT to be part of your group.
- Public or Private groups: Create transparent groups where the community can read the message content or private groups where only the group members can read the chat messages.
- Group Meta: Have fun with it! Select a funny group name, add a group description, and select your best group picture.
- Add/remove admins and members: Add and remove wallet addresses to the group or promote them to become group admins so they can change group information.
- Share Files: Not only can you chat with your web3 friends, but you can also share hilarious GIFs, awesome images, and even important files.

What‚Äôs more? Each wallet can create up to 10 groups.

With Push Group Chat, the possibilities are endless!

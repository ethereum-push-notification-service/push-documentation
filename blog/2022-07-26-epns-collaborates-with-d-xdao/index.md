<SubHeader>EPNS and DXdao team up to create a communication channel for Swapr updates.</SubHeader>

The term blockchain technology is almost synonymous with decentralization these days. This technology made it possible for a network of participants from different parts of the world to collaborate and run the blockchain network on their terms. All without the need for centralized authorities.

However, the degree of decentralization of blockchain-based protocols is determined not just by their architecture but also by the way in which they are governed and operated. In this regard, DXdao is DeFi’s super scalable collective that personifies decentralization. With an innovative suite of products, this protocol aims to provide decentralized governance solutions for DeFi protocols to help scale the DeFi industry as a whole. On this ambitious journey, we at EPNS are pleased to collaborate with DXdao to enable push notifications for Swapr Campaign updates and uphold the spirit of decentralization.

### How DXdao Can Benefit From Push Notifications
As its name suggests, DXdao is a decentralized autonomous organization that is owned and operated by its community of users. It builds solutions for the development, growth, and governance of DeFi products, with a special emphasis on governance. It has an illustrious list of products that provide services ranging from automated market making and predictions to token launching and programmable incentives.

DeFi protocols can integrate these products into their own platforms to create super scalable platforms. And, through one of its star products Swapr, DXdao provides a multi-chain AMM with a suite of unique features including LP governance, DIY farming, and much more. However, without the help of a reliable communication channel, it is difficult to keep users up to date with all events and news to maximize their participation in Swapr. This is where DXdao’s integration of EPNS could be game-changing.

### What Does the Collaboration Entail
Through our collaboration with DXdao, we aim to build a robust communication channel through which the network can keep its participants updated about all Swapr campaign events. Users can subscribe to the official channel on EPNS to receive notifications whenever

- A campaign in Swapr is expired
- A new campaign is starting

As DXdao continues to revolutionize and fully decentralize the DeFi ecosystem, we are pleased to collaborate with them to ensure the greatest user experience for all participants. We are hopeful that EPNS push notifications will become an integral part of DXdao.

### About DXdao

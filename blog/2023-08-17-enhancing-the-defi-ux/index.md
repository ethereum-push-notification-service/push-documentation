Introducing this week‚Äôs ‚ÄòFrens of Push‚Äô: [QuickSwap](https://quickswap.exchange/), the next-gen layer-2 DEX and AMM on Polygonüéâ

QuickSwap is revolutionizing the DeFi landscape by offering lightning-fast transaction speeds and near-zero gas fees, making it an attractive platform for traders, swappers, liquidity providers, and yield farmers. Through its Automated Market Maker (AMM) model, QuickSwap enables users to exchange tokens seamlessly in liquidity pools without the need for a traditional order book.

In addition to its core offerings, QuickSwap is building out its DragonFi Ecosystem as a one-stop shop for DeFi on Polygon ‚Äî a place where Polygon users can come to trade, lend and borrow funds, play games, and more! This acts as a hub for various products such as QuickPerps, a decentralized Perpetual Exchange, and the Gaming Hub, further enriching the DeFi landscape.

In a significant development recently announced, we are excited to share that the [$PUSH token is now live on QuickSwap](https://medium.com/push-protocol/push-is-live-on-polygon-quickswap-b683ef0f71d8), expanding the utility and accessibility of the $PUSH token within the Polygon ecosystem, and offering users new avenues to engage with the token. In addition, Quickswap will be using Push‚Äôs communication layer to send notifications to DeFi users on the platform and alert them about their positions and other on-chain actions.

This edition of ‚ÄúFrens of Push‚Äù features an interview with QuickSwap, shedding light on their mission, technology, and collaboration with Push. Let‚Äôs dive in!


### 1. Tell us about QuickSwap ‚Äî what‚Äôs it about, and what problem does QuickSwap solve?
QuickSwap is the leading DEX and AMM on Polygon PoS, Polygon zkEVM, and Dogechain where users can trade, swap, LP, farm, and take part in other DeFi activities at lightning fast speeds and with near-zero gas fees. The DEX has helped spark adoption for DeFi across the Polygon ecosystem and has become an attractive environment for DeFi because of fast transaction speeds and low gas fees, in addition to the DragonFi ecosystem which serves as a hub for other products, such as QuickPerps (decentralized Perpetual Exchange) and the Gaming Hub.

### 2. How do developers use QuickSwap? (feel free to add a step-by-step guide or quick tutorial like a video here )

### 3. What‚Äôs the 2023 plan for QuickSwap‚Äôs ecosystem?
Multiple integrations with projects on all 3 ecosystems and QuickPerps ‚Äî more info to be revealed but integrations mostly aimed at enhancing the UI/UX and adding more features for DEX users

### 4. How is QuickSwap using Push‚Äôs web3 communication layer?
QuickSwap will be using Push‚Äôs Web3 communication layer to enable push notifications for DeFi users on the DEX who want to be alerted about their positions and any other on-chain actions related to swaps, LP, farms, leverage trades, etc.

### 5. How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?
It‚Äôs a pretty smooth UI and easy to understand, I like the simplicity. It seems to also offer a wide range of notifications and features

### 6. What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?
Perhaps besides just on-chain actions users could have a checklist of things they want to opt into for each protocol, such as other types of news feeds, updates on token listings, etc.

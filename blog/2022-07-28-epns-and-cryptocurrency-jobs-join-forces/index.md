<SubHeader>EPNS collaborates with Cryptocurrency Jobs, the leading job board in the crypto space, to bring a decentralized communication medium to the platform.</SubHeader>

One of the fastest growing sectors in the world, cryptocurrency, and the broader blockchain-based industries are home to some of the most innovative companies in the world. These companies are in their initial stages and perpetually on the lookout for skilled professionals who can help realize their vision. As such, Cryptocurrency Jobs is the leading job board for the blockchain and crypto industries. The platform curates the best jobs at leading blockchain-based companies and startups to help professionals readily grab the opportunities at hand.

Today, we at EPNS are proud to announce a strategic alliance with Cryptocurrency Jobs to enable direct communication between the platform and its users. By employing decentralized push notifications, this alliance will bring new job opportunities and updates to web3 professionals right on their devices.

## Decentralized Push Notifications for Web3 Professionals
Cryptocurrency Jobs launched in 2017 and the platform firmly believes that the decentralized future is people-centric. In these five years, the platform has connected talented individuals with companies of every size. Now, with the rapid evolutions in the web3 space, web3 professionals and companies spend most of their time on decentralized applications. As such, Cryptocurrency Jobs can vastly benefit from a decentralized communication medium that directly connects the platform and professionals.

This is precisely where the collaboration with EPNS comes into play. As the decentralized communication medium for web3, we have created a channel for the Cryptocurrency Jobs platform. This channel is available on the EPNS homepage and web3 professionals in need of a job can easily subscribe to it as well as teams that are hiring. When they subscribe, they will receive decentralized push notifications whenever

- New job opportunities are available on the platform
- The weekly newsletter is published
As EPNS has a DApp, web3 professionals who depend on decentralized communication will never miss an update from the platform. However, EPNS also has a mobile application and a Chrome extension to ensure that the subscribers are always in the loop.

As Cryptocurrency Jobs continues to connect cutting-edge companies in web3 with top professionals, we’re pleased to work together with them on this journey and hope to become an integral part of their operations.

Virtual events have become a cornerstone of modern communication, enabling people from around the world to connect and engage in a wide range of activities. However, traditional virtual event technologies often come with limitations that hinder the full potential of these experiences. With the emergence of Web3 and the power of decentralized technologies, thereâ€™s an opportunity to transform virtual events into more immersive, secure, and interactive experiences.

## The Current Landscape of Virtual Events Technology
Virtual events leverage various web technologies to enable remote participation and create interactive event experiences. These technologies typically include:

1. <b>Live Streaming</b>: Virtual events utilize live streaming technologies to broadcast real-time audio and video content to participants. Platforms leverage protocols like WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) and adaptive streaming techniques to ensure high-quality streaming experiences.
2. <b>Video Conferencing</b>: Video conferencing solutions enable real-time communication and interaction among event participants. These solutions incorporate features like video and audio calls, screen sharing, and chat functionalities to facilitate communication and collaboration during virtual events.
3. <b>Content Sharing Platforms</b>: Virtual events often involve the sharing of multimedia content such as presentations, documents, and videos. Content sharing platforms enable organizers to upload and distribute content to participants, ensuring seamless access to event materials.
4. <b>Web-based Access</b>: Virtual events are typically accessed through web browsers, allowing participants to join the event from any device with internet connectivity. Web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript enable the creation of user interfaces, interactive elements, and responsive design, ensuring compatibility across different devices and operating systems.

Today, virtual events primarily rely on centralized platforms and technologies that come with their own set of challenges. However, these centralized platforms face challenges that hinder their full potential. Decentralized video chat, on the other hand, provides a viable solution to these challenges.

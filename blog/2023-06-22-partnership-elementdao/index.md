Weâ€™re thrilled to share that ElementDAO, the governance platform that empowers decision-making at ElementFi, is partnering up with Push to enhance community-driven decision-making.

ElementFi (now expanded into [DELV](https://www.delv.tech/)), is a leading protocol that enables users to seek high fixed yield income in the DeFi market.

ElementDAO, as the governance platform for ElementFi, plays a pivotal role in making important decisions at ElementFi, thereby contributing to the creation of this comprehensive suite of fixed yield income products. With this newfound partnership, ElementDAO is leveraging Pushâ€™s communication capabilities to enhance transparency, participation, and efficiency within its governance ecosystem. This partnership marks a significant step towards empowering stakeholders at ElementFi.

For ElementDAO users, you can opt-in to [receive notificationsðŸ‘‰ here](http://app.push.org/channels?channel=0x349da2A6825284E9E181D46D664b95aecE86da56)

## Push X ElementDAO
Decentralized notifications, powered by Push, establish a direct line of communication between ElementDAO and its ELFI holders. This seamless flow of information ensures that ElementDAO members stay informed, empowered, and ready to actively participate in the decision-making processes that shape the projectâ€™s future.

By leveraging Push, ElementDAO members will receive timely notifications that keep them up to date on crucial developments within the ecosystem such as when:

- A new proposal has made it to the voting phase
- 24 hours are left to cast a vote on a proposal
- Voting results are out

The use cases for notifications extend beyond governance proposals. Users can also expect to receive ad-hoc announcements, updates on new feature launches, maintenance windows, and various other project-related communications in the future.

Weâ€™re extremely excited to be collaborating with the ElementDAO team and are looking forward to setting a new standard for DeFi communications. We also look forward to future integrations with other DELV products â€” Harsh Rajat, CEO & Founder of Push Protocol

Weâ€™re inviting ElementDAO members to embrace this new era of empowerment and actively participate in shaping the future of ElementDAO and the ElementFi. Opt in to the ElementDAO channel and never miss a beat!

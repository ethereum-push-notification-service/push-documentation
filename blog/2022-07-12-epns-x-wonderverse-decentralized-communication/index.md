<SubHeader>EPNS and Wonderverse join forces to enable direct communication for users through decentralized push notifications.</SubHeader>

Wonderverse, web3’s project management platform and EPNS team up in a pilot collaboration to bring decentralized push notifications for users. As such, Wonderverse will now be able to seamlessly interact with its users and keep them updated about the status of their tasks and other activities.

### Bringing Project Management to Web3
Businesses, no matter how small or big, deal with a myriad of tasks, projects, and plans. The smooth running of all these operations requires collaboration among all the people involved in the business. This is precisely why project management tools rose to fame in the last decade. They allow businesses to collaborate on project planning, resource allocation, and performance monitoring. The tools also provide the ability to establish a pyramid of tasks for effective completion.

However, the popular project management tools of today are centralized and more suited for web2 projects. The decentralized web3 community that is now swarming with innovative projects, needs a decentralized project management tool and Wonderverse fills this gap. It is a web3 project management platform that allows DAOs to manage and track their workflows. From allocating tasks to managing resources and people, Wonderverse is a one-stop-shop for all things DAO management.

The past part is that it integrates crypto into project management, allowing users to pay and get paid in cryptocurrencies. With Wonderverse, web3 projects can do away with web2 project management tools and get the full web3 experience. In this regard, Wonderverse needs a communication medium that coordinates interactions between users and the platform. This is where the collaboration with EPNS is crucial.

## What Does the Collaboration Entail
The main aim of our collaboration with Wonderverse is the creation of a decentralized communication channel that enables direct communication between users and the platform. This channel will be housed on EPNS and users of Wonderverse can subscribe to it to become beneficiaries of decentralized notifications. They can expect to receive notifications whenever

- A new task is assigned
- Due dates for a task are approaching/reached
This saves users from manually checking for updates, making the platform easy to use. EPNS has a Chrome extension, a DAPP, and a mobile application to ensure that users do not miss out on notifications on any device.

We’re excited to strike this collaboration with Wonderverse and hope to become an integral part of their operations.

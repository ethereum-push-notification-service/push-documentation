<b>Launch of Rockstars of EPNS V2</b>

![Docusaurus Image](./image-4.png)
Almost about a year ago, EPNS did a really awesome activity for our amazing community!

We kicked off [The Rockstars of EPNS](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/the-first-nft-collection-from-epns-677e23173c95), our first collection of [NFTS](https://opensea.io/collection/rockstars-of-epns) which we dropped to celebrate the launch of $PUSH!

At EPNS we are huge fans of the NFT space and the emerging creator economy and we were so thrilled to be witnessing a wave of adoption among creators and artists.

So, we decided to throw our hat in the ring by supporting artists, celebrating our origins, and giving back to the community along the way. And that was just in time for the $PUSH token sale and the EPNS mainnet launch! üôå

And guess what? Just in time for NFT NYC, we‚Äôre super excited and thrilled to announce the launch of <b>The Rockstars of EPNS V2.</b>

And of course you‚Äôll get to know how you could partake in collecting these NFTs, pretty soon.

Stay tuned for more updates on our social media for that one!

#### Lastly, What‚Äôs #MYNFTStory

<iframe width="100%" height="382" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rPtUvV_1hW0" title="At @NFTNYC we ask you &quot;What&#39;s #MyNFTStory&quot;" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Since NFT NYC is also one of the biggest NFT Parties across the world, we were like, almost certain that a bunch of us frens would share a ton of #NFTStories as conversation starters, icebreakers and what not!

And that‚Äôs when we struck this idea of launching a really cool campaign where you ask yourselves

‚ÄòWhats <b>#MYNFTStory?‚Äô</b>

- #### You might be an NFTHODLer
- #### An NFT Artist!
- #### Founder of an NFTProject
- #### Or just part of NFT Projects and eager to get in

A chance to share your NFTStory and heck, even WIN something BIG!

#### Participate in this campaign of ours!

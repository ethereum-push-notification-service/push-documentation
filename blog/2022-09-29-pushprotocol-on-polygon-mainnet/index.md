Today, we’re thrilled to announce that [Push Protocol](http://push.org/), previously Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS), has launched on Polygon, enabling seamless, web3-native communication to the thousands of Polygon dApps and hundreds of thousands of active users.

The Push Protocol launch on Polygon’s mainnet means that Polygon app developers can immediately begin integrating Push into their apps, launching channels, and enabling notifications for users (start [here](https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-guides/create-your-notif-channel/enabling-channel-on-other-chains/polygon-channel-setup)). Soon, Push Protocol will announce launch partners to allow users to begin subscribing to live channels, opting to receive notifications when certain on- or off-chain conditions are met.

## Polygon & Push
Polygon, previously Matic Network, is a suite of layer 2 protocols backed by an ecosystem of next-generation apps. Polygon has a range of products that aim to solve the underlying challenges with traditional blockchain architectures, all while improving the user experience for end-users to support the mass adoption of web3 products and services. Push Protocol’s launch on Polygon will address the lack of communication between apps and users to support the Polygon ecosystem in improving the web3 user experience.

More than 37,000 apps are built on Polygon, offering a tremendous opportunity to create custom communication channels and user-based messages that users, developers, and stakeholders will benefit from. As with other apps, developers can easily add a notification service to their Polygon-based app and enable app-to-wallet communication. Users on Polygon can use wallet-to-wallet communication for just about anything.

Lately, Polygon has become the go-to platform for web2-based institutions to onboard into web3, such as Meta, Adobe, Stripe, and Starbucks. The new dapps built by these institutions can benefit from the flexible communication offered by Push Protocol, which gives them the ability to have direct control over messages, all while preventing spam. Users expect applications in web3 to provide a similar standard of user experience as they do with the applications they currently use daily. Users interacting with apps on Polygon will have the same user experience they do today when on these platforms by using Push Protocol.

Smart contracts on Polygon powered by Push Protocol can include notifications that can reach any wallet, app, mobile app, and plugin. Push’s mainnet launch was in January 2022. Since then, the protocol has powered 17 million notifications on over 100 channels to close to 60,000 subscribers, making it the largest decentralized communication platform in web3.

<i>“Push Protocol represents a fundamental communication layer for web3 that is sorely missing. By unlocking instant, direct notifications within the Polygon ecosystem and beyond, Push evolves the services many of us take for granted — bringing us one step closer to a truly composable and decentralized web.”</i> said Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon.<br/><br/>

<i>“Our launch on the Polygon mainnet, immediately following our rebrand from EPNS to Push Protocol, is a pivotal moment for our ecosystem. Communication is a critical component for the future of the internet, and Push is rapidly expanding beyond the Ethereum network and beyond push notifications by building the missing piece of web3,”</i> said Harsh Rajat, co-founder of Push Protocol.<br/><br/>

The recent rebrand from EPNS to Push signals two evolutions from the service: the move beyond Ethereum and the move beyond push notifications to all forms of communication. Today’s announcement about Polygon’s integration of Push Protocol is the service’s first move into multi-chain, with more announcements about networks and communication types on the horizon. Let’s push for web3 communication!

## About Push Protocol

Push is the communication protocol of web3. Push protocol enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet /frontend to tap into the network and get the communication across.

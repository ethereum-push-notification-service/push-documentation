## Push x THENAüèõÔ∏è

This partnership is a result of a shared commitment to transparency and security. Together, Push and THENA aim to provide users with more direct and secure communication, helping THENA users stay informed about critical events and enabling better governance on the platform. This is all happening through Push‚Äôs web3 native notifications.

<blockquote>Crypto is all about being ahead of the curve and pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible. Push notifications for web3 are the natural evolution of the user experience, and we‚Äôre excited to be implementing this game-changing feature on THENA. With this partnership, we‚Äôre paving the way for a more accessible and user-friendly DeFi ecosystem, and we can‚Äôt wait to see what other innovative solutions we can bring to the table. ‚Äî 0xApollo, THENA‚Äôs CMO</blockquote>

As a result of this partnership, THENA users can expect to receive real-time notifications about critical events such as:

- Liquidation alerts
- Change of vault or strategies
- Reminders to vote on governance proposals

By enabling informed decision-making and enhancing governance, we are empowering users to take full control of their investments on THENA while encouraging more active participation in the growth of the platform.

This collaboration is simply the first step in our journey, and we are eager to explore other opportunities that can bring more value to BNBChain DeFi users.

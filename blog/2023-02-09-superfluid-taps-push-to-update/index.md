superfluid, the leading asset streaming protocol that enables web3 native subscriptions, salaries, and rewards for DAOs and crypto-native businesses, is partnering with Push to enable direct communication between users and their platformðŸŽ‰

This collaboration will result in Superfluid users receiving decentralized notifications and alerts directly on their devices.

The monumental growth of crypto-native businesses has led to increasing demand for asset streaming. Whether itâ€™s employee payroll, web3 subscriptions, or real-time investing, the need for ongoing money transfers has become more important than ever. Superfluid solves this exact problem by enabling continuous money streaming, thereby helping users, developers, and projects simplify recurring value transfer in web3.

With a single on-chain transaction, Superfluid allows users to send ongoing money streams that transfer value second by second in a constant flow. In effect, crypto-native organizations can now ensure a smooth and efficient flow of money to multiple employees or contributors on a recurring basis or receive on-chain subscription revenue.

## Push X Superfluid
As a money-streaming platform, Superfluid empowers individuals and organizations to handle payments and subscriptions in a trustless, decentralized manner. The creation of such an ecosystem calls for a transparent communication model between Superfluid and its users. This is precisely where Push comes in!

<blockquote>
<i>
'Weâ€™re incredibly excited to integrate with Push. Although our ecosystem has seen tremendous growth to date, itâ€™s difficult to build engaging web3 apps without having a direct communication channel with users. This is especially challenging when users are primarily identified by their wallet addresses.

With Push, we can now provide users with time-sensitive notifications in a secure, decentralized, and personalized way.' â€” Francesco Renzi, CEO and Co-Founder of Superfluid
</i>
</blockquote>

With this collaboration, Superfluid users can opt-in to notifications through the Push apps for when:

- Super Token balances are low for outgoing streams
- A Super Token balance hit zero and outgoing streams were liquidated
As a result of this integration, Superfluid will have a verified channel on Push that users or developers can try out to subscribe to alerts and updates about their streams directly on their devices.

In the near future, Push will feature as part of Superfluid Dashboard notifications, and we hope that many others in the Superfluid ecosystem make use of these capabilities too.

<blockquote>
<i>
'Weâ€™re thrilled to announce our partnership with Superfluid, a pioneer in web3 money streaming. By combining Pushâ€™s web3-native communication tools with Superfluidâ€™s innovative payment primitive, weâ€™re enabling a truly seamless and connected web3 experience for Superfluid users.

However, this is just the first stage of our integration with Superfluid and we canâ€™t wait to provide more enhancements in the near future!' â€” Harsh Rajat, CEO of Push Protocol

</blockquote>

Push is excited to be encouraging financial flexibility with Superfluid, and looks forward to individuals and businesses having greater awareness around their streams!

Beyond that, we are looking forward to delivering more decentralized notifications to Superfluid users in the coming months enabling deeper notification integration for future versions of Superfluid.

The user experience enhancements for Superfluid users is only just beginning!

## About Superfluid
[Superfluid](http://superfluid.finance/) is the leading asset streaming protocol that enables web3 native subscriptions, salaries, and rewards for DAOs and crypto-native businesses. Superfluid streams transfer value in a constant flow over time between wallets in a non-custodial and permissionless manner. Superfluid Protocol can be used to describe cash flows and execute them automatically on-chain, over time, and in a non-interactive way.

Money streams are programmable, composable, and modular, allowing developers to build custom applications on top of the protocol. No capital is locked up, and all inflows and outflows are netted in real-time at every block without consuming any gas. Ongoing streams can be forwarded as they are received to both wallets and applications, eliminating delays and drastically increasing capital efficiency.
